		Documentation on the World Wide Web is normally picked up by browsing with a W3 browser. If you need a printed copy, it is also available in "laTeX" and "Postscript" formats by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch.
		
		<p>This document introduces the "World Wide Web Book", a paper document derived from the hypertext about the project. The book contains</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>General informaion about the project, people and history;</li>
			<li>A list of things to be done, including how YOU can put data onto the web;</li>
			<li>A technical discussion of the design issues in projects such as WWW;</li>
			<li>Actual details of the implementation of the WWW project</li>
			<li>Such low-level details as software architecures and coding standards</li>
		
		</ul>
		The text of the book has been automatically generated from the hypertext, so it may seem strange in places due to links in the hypertext which are not there in the printed copy.
		<p>The authors of the material are general members of the W3 team at CERN, except where otherwise noted.</p>
